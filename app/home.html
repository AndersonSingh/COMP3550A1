                        <p>Now, have you ever wondered what causes crime? What factors influence its growth in an area or nationally. If so then you should visit our cause and effects section to learn more. Educating the public about what influences crime is one of the first steps to finding solutions.</p>
                        <p> While on the topic of finding solutions, another section we have is one that educates our users and our public on what they can do to help deter or even prevent crime in their area altogether. Crime affects everyone and can only be curbed if everyone works together against it.</p>
                        <p> If this intrests you please click the first and second images to go to the Cause and Effect and Solutions pages respectfully </p>

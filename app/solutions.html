			<p> The police system in the Caribbean
				faces several challenges to complete a transition
				to citizen security. These include, first,
				improving police capacity and capabilities
				to enhance performance in terms of responsiveness
				and effectiveness. The second challenge
				is promoting legitimacy, which comes
				from integrity and improved accountability,
				and eradicating corruption, which
				weakens public confidence. Third is reducing
				abuses of power and fully recognising
				human rights. Overcoming these problems
				will allow community policing and citizens’
				cooperation to prevent crime and control
				criminality.
			</p>
			<p>
				The survey results provide some grounds
				for optimism. Citizens perceive their police
				forces as moderately legitimate and competent
				and show willingness to become coproducers
				of their own security (chart 6).
				Further, the citizens of each nation manifest
				support for governments investing more resources
				in the reform of the police services
				in order to increase their effectiveness.
				Within Caribbean justice systems, legal
				codes and institutional arrangements continue
				to present characteristics of the colonial
				legacy. Arbitrary arrest and detention
				is prohibited by the Constitution, and the
				systems allow visiting of incarcerated persons
				by external observers. But the criminal
				justice system still faces challenges. Case
				processing delays and backlogs, low conviction
				rates, prison overcrowding and insufficient
				alternatives to prison, all strongly
				interconnected, impact on the capacity for
				fairness, effectiveness, transparency and accountability.

			<p> The efforts by governments and experiences

				show a new and positive direction that
				fosters the transition to citizen security
				in the context of the democratic system

				The states’ respect for civil and political
				liberties creates favourable circumstances.
				So, too, do the participation of civic

				Levels of insecurity remain high in the
				region and have a negative impact on
				human development. For Caribbean
				people crime, violence and insecurity
				are important social problems since they
				limit individuals’ choices and liberties;
				represent threats to their physical integrity
				and patrimony and disrupt their
				daily lives. Insecurity is partly rooted in
				a lack of confidence in the institutions of
				the state, in the police and in the justice
				system.
				There is a demand for change that
				calls for greater attention to crime as a
				social problem and for the recognition
				that security cannot reliably rest on the
				capabilities and performances of law
				enforcement.
				There is official recognition of the
				need for comprehensive reform of
				the police and justice services in
				several countries. There are promising
				Caribbean efforts in this direction, but
				these have neither been evaluated nor
				properly documented.

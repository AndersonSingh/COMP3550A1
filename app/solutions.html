		<p> The police system in the Caribbean
			faces several challenges to complete a transition
			to citizen security. These include, first,
			improving police capacity and capabilities
			to enhance performance in terms of responsiveness
			and effectiveness. The second challenge
			is promoting legitimacy, which comes
			from integrity and improved accountability,
			and eradicating corruption, which
			weakens public confidence. Third is reducing
			abuses of power and fully recognising
			human rights. Overcoming these problems
			will allow community policing and citizens’
			cooperation to prevent crime and control
			criminality.
			The survey results provide some grounds
			for optimism. Citizens perceive their police
			forces as moderately legitimate and competent
			and show willingness to become coproducers
			of their own security (chart 6).
			Further, the citizens of each nation manifest
			support for governments investing more resources
			in the reform of the police services
			in order to increase their effectiveness.
			Within Caribbean justice systems, legal
			codes and institutional arrangements continue
			to present characteristics of the colonial
			legacy. Arbitrary arrest and detention
			is prohibited by the Constitution, and the
			systems allow visiting of incarcerated persons
			by external observers. But the criminal
			justice system still faces challenges. Case
			processing delays and backlogs, low conviction
			rates, prison overcrowding and insufficient
			alternatives to prison, all strongly
			interconnected, impact on the capacity for
			fairness, effectiveness, transparency and accountability.

	<p> The efforts by governments and experiences
		already underway in the Caribbean
		show a new and positive direction that
		fosters the transition to citizen security
		in the context of the democratic system
		and constitutional form of government.
		The states’ respect for civil and political
		liberties creates favourable circumstances.
		So, too, do the participation of civic
		organizations, more engaged publics,
		and the media, which contributes to creating
		more awareness on pressing issues,
		promoting debate and demanding accountability
		in public actions.
		Levels of insecurity remain high in the
		region and have a negative impact on
		human development. For Caribbean
		people crime, violence and insecurity
		are important social problems since they
		limit individuals’ choices and liberties;
		represent threats to their physical integrity
		and patrimony and disrupt their
		daily lives. Insecurity is partly rooted in
		a lack of confidence in the institutions of
		the state, in the police and in the justice
		system.
		There is a demand for change that
		calls for greater attention to crime as a
		social problem and for the recognition
		that security cannot reliably rest on the
		capabilities and performances of law
		enforcement.
		There is official recognition of the
		need for comprehensive reform of
		the police and justice services in
		several countries. There are promising
		Caribbean efforts in this direction, but
		these have neither been evaluated nor
		properly documented.
